# 📚 Deep Learning Systems Introduction

[Course Link](https://dlsyscourse.org/lectures/)

This document reviews the main themes and key takeaways from Deep Learning Systems: Algorithms and Implementation** at **Carnegie Mellon University**, taught by **J. Zico Kolter** and **Tianqi Chen**.


## 1. 🚀 Why Study Deep Learning (DL) and DL Systems?

The lecture emphasizes the powerful capabilities of modern DL, showcasing examples like:

- **Image Classification**: *AlexNet* achieved state-of-the-art performance in 2012.
- **Game Playing**: *AlphaGo* defeated top Go players in 2016.
- **Image Generation**: *StyleGAN* created realistic fake faces, and *Stable Diffusion* generated images from text.
- **Protein Folding Prediction**: *AlphaFold 2* achieved near-perfect accuracy in predicting 3D protein structures.
- **Text Generation**: *GPT-3* showcased advanced text generation, even writing course summaries.

Beyond large companies, the lecture highlights contributions from smaller teams and individuals, such as:

- *DeOldify* for colorizing old photos.
- *PyTorch Image Models (timm)* for image classification model implementations.

The lecture attributes DL's widespread adoption to user-friendly automatic differentiation libraries, like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**. *Tianqi Chen* shared a personal story: building a capable CNN in 2012 took 44,000 lines of code and six months, while today, similar work can be done in 100 lines and a few hours!

### 🎯 Why Study DL Systems?
1. **Build New DL Systems**: The field evolves quickly, and frameworks like **JAX** continue to emerge. A deep understanding allows for new framework development.
2. **Use Existing Systems More Effectively**: Knowledge of DL systems helps in writing efficient, scalable models—especially for research with novel architectures.
3. **The Fun of It**: DL systems (automatic differentiation, gradient-based optimization) are complex yet surprisingly simple at their core and can be implemented with minimal code.


## 2. 📅 Course Information and Logistics

## 3. 🔑 Key Quotes

> "Controversial (?) claim: the single largest driver of widespread adoption of deep learning has been the creation of easy-to-use automatic differentiation libraries." *(intro.pdf)*

> "Understanding deep learning systems is a “superpower” that will let you accomplish your research aims much more efficiently." *(intro.pdf)*

> "The first time you build your automatic differentiation library, and realize you can take gradient of a gradient without actually knowing how you would even go about deriving that mathematically…" *(intro.pdf)*

> "Final project should involve developing a substantial new piece of functionality in Needle, or implement some new architecture in the framework (note that you must implement it in Needle, you cannot, e.g., use PyTorch or TensorFlow for the final project)." *(intro.pdf)*

Overall, these materials present a compelling case for studying deep learning systems, highlighting DL’s transformative power, the importance of understanding inner workings, and the practical advantages for research and development. The course promises a rigorous and rewarding experience for those diving into the world of deep learning systems.
