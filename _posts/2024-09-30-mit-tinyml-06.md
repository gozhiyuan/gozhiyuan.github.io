| Granularity         | Description                                                                                                                                             | Advantages                                                                                                                                                            | Disadvantages                                                                                                            | Use Cases                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Per-Tensor**       | A single scaling factor and zero point are used for the entire tensor.                                                                                  | Simplest to implement; requires storing only one scaling factor and zero point for the entire tensor.                                                                | May lead to significant accuracy degradation, especially in smaller models, as it doesn't account for different channel ranges. | Works reasonably well for large models where variations across channels are less significant.                                                                                                                               |
| **Per-Channel**      | Each channel has its own scaling factor and zero point.                                                                                                 | More accurate than per-tensor quantization, especially for smaller models. Allows for different scaling factors per channel, capturing variations across output channels. | Requires storing a scaling factor and zero point for each channel, increasing memory overhead.                           | Ideal for models with significantly different weight ranges across channels, which is common. It's the preferred granularity for many models.                                                                 |
| **Group Quantization**| The tensor is divided into groups, each sharing a scaling factor and zero point.                                                                         | Balances accuracy and memory usage. Fine-grained scaling factors compared to per-tensor quantization. Crucial for optimal performance in lower bit-width scenarios.    | More complex to implement than per-tensor or per-channel quantization. Requires more scaling factors than per-tensor.    | Useful for very low-bit quantization (4-bit or below), such as in the Blackwell architecture. Helps balance accuracy and hardware efficiency for FP4 AI.                                                      |
| **Per-Vector**       | A scaling factor is applied to each sub-vector within a tensor. Uses both a floating-point coarse-grained scale for the entire tensor and integer scaling factors per sub-vector. | Finer granularity than per-channel and group quantization. Achieves a balance between accuracy and hardware efficiency. Less expensive integer scaling factors at finer granularity. | Requires additional memory for storing scaling factors for each sub-vector.                                                | Suitable for fine-grained control in lower precision quantization (e.g., 4-bit), often used with micro-exponent data types.                                                                                             |
| **Shared Micro-exponent (MX) Data Type** | Combines shared exponent bits and mantissa bits, along with scaling factors (e.g., MX4 with 1 sign bit, 2 mantissa bits, 1 exponent bit shared by 2 values). | Useful in very low precision quantization (e.g., FP4), providing a fine-grained scaling factor for better accuracy. Popular with Blackwell architecture.                | More complex to implement due to the unique combination of mantissa and exponent bits.                                   | Gaining popularity in very low-bit quantization (4-bit and below). Used in Blackwell GPUs to maintain accuracy for FP4 models.                                                                                           |


### Key Takeaways 📝

- **Trade-offs**: There is a trade-off between the granularity of quantization and the memory overhead. Finer granularity (e.g., per-channel, group, per-vector) results in better accuracy but increases storage requirements for scaling factors.
- **Model Size**: **Per-tensor quantization** works well for very large models where differences across channels are less noticeable. However, for smaller models, **per-channel quantization** is preferable due to the significant variations in weight ranges.
- **Hardware**: Certain granularities are tailored for specialized hardware. For example, **Blackwell GPUs** support **group quantization** using micro-tensor scaling.
- **Low Precision**: For **very low-bit quantization** (e.g., 4-bit or below), **group quantization**, **per-vector quantization**, and the **MX data type** become increasingly important for preserving accuracy.
- **Accuracy**: **Per-channel quantization** offers better accuracy than per-tensor quantization, as it uses unique scaling factors for each channel. **Per-vector quantization** provides even finer-grained scaling, leading to reduced quantization error.

## 5️⃣ Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a fine-tuning technique that emulates the effects of quantization during the training process to recover accuracy that might be lost when quantizing a neural network. The goal is to make the model more robust to the effects of quantization, especially at lower bit-widths. 🧠💡

![alt_text](/assets/images/tinyml-2024/06/2.png "image_tooltip")


### 1. Maintaining a Full Precision Copy of Weights 🏋️‍♂️
- During QAT, a full-precision (e.g., 32-bit floating-point) copy of the weights is maintained in the background. This is crucial because it allows for the accumulation of small gradient changes without loss of precision. 🔢
- The quantized weights are used for the forward pass, but the full precision weights are updated during the backward pass. 🔄
- The full precision copy is only used during training; at deployment time, only the quantized weights are used for inference. 🚀


### 2. Simulating Quantization 🎛️
- During the forward pass, both the weights and activations are quantized to simulate the inference-time quantization. This is also known as "fake quantization". 👾
- This simulation is done by adding "quantization nodes" in the network that quantize the weights and activations.
    - For example, a weight 'W' is quantized to 'qW' using a scaling factor and zero point, as in linear quantization. The full precision weight 'W' is maintained and updated during training. 🏋️‍♂️
    - Similarly, activations are also quantized. 🎚️
- This ensures that the network is trained with discrete-valued weights and activations as they would be during inference. The network learns to adapt to the reduced precision of the quantized values. 🧑‍🏫


### 3. Straight-Through Estimator (STE) 🔄
- The quantization process is discrete and non-differentiable, so the gradient of the quantization function would be zero almost everywhere. ❌
- To enable backpropagation, a straight-through estimator (STE) is used. This means that the gradient is passed through the quantization function as if it were an identity function. ➡️
    - For example, if Q(W) is the quantized weight, the gradient ∂L/∂Q(W) is treated the same as ∂L/∂W. 🔄
    - In essence, the gradient with respect to the quantized value is passed directly back to the original full-precision value. 💬


### 4. Backward Pass and Weight Update 🔁
- During the backward pass, the gradients are calculated as if the weights and activations had not been quantized. 📉
- The gradients are used to update the full-precision weights. 📈
- The full-precision weights are updated to minimize the loss function, effectively fine-tuning the network to be more robust to quantization. 🎯


### 5. Fine-tuning 🔧
- QAT usually involves fine-tuning a pre-trained floating-point model. This helps in achieving better accuracy compared to training from scratch using quantized weights and activations. 🏁
- The training process involves multiple epochs. During each epoch, forward and backward passes are performed, which gradually updates the full precision weights to converge to a new set of weights. 🔁


### Example: Let's consider a simple example of a weight 'W' in a neural network. 🎓

1. Initially, 'W' is a full-precision floating-point number. 🧮
2. During the forward pass:
   - 'W' is quantized to a lower precision, resulting in 'qW' by using the scaling factor and the zero point. 📏
   - The quantized weight qW is used for the forward computation. 🔀
   - The activations of the layer are also quantized in a similar manner. 🖥️
3. During the backward pass:
   - The gradients are calculated with respect to the output of the layer. 📊
   - The gradients are passed back through the quantization node using the STE. 🔄
   - The full-precision weight 'W' is updated by the optimizer. 🛠️
4. After the training is complete, the full-precision weights are discarded, and the quantized weights are used for inference. 💡


### Benefits of QAT 🚀
- **Improved Accuracy**: QAT significantly improves the accuracy of quantized models compared to post-training quantization, especially for smaller models. 🎯
- **Robustness to Low Bit-widths**: It makes the model more resilient to the effects of quantization, allowing for the use of lower bit-widths (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit) with less accuracy loss. 🛡️


### Comparison with Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and in LLM Settings 📚🤖

- **PTQ** quantizes a pre-trained model without any fine-tuning. ❌
- **QAT**, on the other hand, fine-tunes the model while taking quantization into account. ✅
- **QAT** typically achieves much better accuracy than PTQ, especially when the bit-width is reduced aggressively. 🔝

#### ● PTQ Can Be Sufficient for LLMs 📉
- Due to their large size, **LLMs** (Large Language Models) are less susceptible to accuracy loss from quantization. 💡
- **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)** can be a practical approach for LLMs and often achieves surprisingly good results without the need for fine-tuning. 🛠️

#### ● QAT Provides Further Gains 📈
- While PTQ may be sufficient in many cases, **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** can provide a boost in accuracy. 🚀
- If the performance of a quantized LLM is not satisfactory after PTQ, **QAT** should be considered to fine-tune the model and improve results. 🔧

#### ● QAT Is Beneficial for Lower Bit-widths 🔥
- When using aggressive quantization with lower bit-widths (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit), **QAT** becomes more valuable. 🏆
- The accuracy loss from PTQ may be too significant, so QAT helps recover accuracy that might be lost during extreme quantization. ⚡

#### ● QAT Offers Fine-tuning 🎯
- **QAT** also fine-tunes the model while being aware of the quantization process. 🧑‍🏫
- This allows the model to adapt to the constraints of quantized computations, improving accuracy and making it more robust to quantization effects. 💪
