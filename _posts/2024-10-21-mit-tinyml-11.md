## EfficientML.ai 📚 Lecture 11: TinyEngine

Modern AI models are becoming increasingly large, demanding substantial computational resources and memory. This creates a gap between the computational demands of these models and the available hardware capabilities. Pruning addresses this gap by reducing model size, memory footprint, and ultimately, energy consumption.

## 🌍 The Challenge of Edge AI

Edge devices, like smartphones, microcontrollers, and laptops, bring AI closer to users but face **severe resource constraints** compared to cloud GPUs or desktops.

## ⚙️ Parallel Computing Techniques

The lecture emphasizes several techniques for accelerating neural network inference on edge devices.

### 🔄 Loop Optimization
1. **Loop Reordering**: Improves **data locality** and reduces cache misses by reordering loop iterations.  
   - Example: Reordering `i, j, k` to `i, k, j` in matrix multiplication improved performance **12x** on Intel Xeon CPUs.
   
2. **Loop Tiling**: Divides loops into smaller "tiles" to fit working sets into cache.  
   - Multi-level tiling targets different cache levels (L1, L2, etc.).

3. **Loop Unrolling**: Reduces branching overhead by replicating loop bodies.  
   - Tradeoff: Increased binary size but faster execution for predictable iterations.

### 🛠️ SIMD Programming
**Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)** executes one operation on multiple data points simultaneously.  
- Leverages vector registers for increased throughput and energy efficiency.

> *"Instead of just using one instruction to operate on one piece of data ... we use one instruction to work on multiple pieces of data."*

### 🌐 Multithreading
Allows concurrent execution of threads within a process, boosting performance.  
- Tools: **Pthreads** and **OpenMP**.

### 🎮 CUDA Programming
Harnesses GPUs for massive parallel computation via grids of thread blocks.  
- **Key Strategy**: Optimize memory spaces (global, shared, private) for efficiency.

## CUDA Programming Explained ⚡

CUDA programming, introduced by Nvidia in 2006, enables developers to use **GPUs** to accelerate computation. Below is an explanation of the key concepts:


### CUDA Thread Hierarchy 🧵

CUDA programming relies on a hierarchy of threads:

- **Grid**: A grid is a collection of thread blocks. 🌐
- **Thread Block**: A thread block is a group of threads that can cooperate and share data. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution in CUDA. 🧵

Each thread has a unique **ID** that can be up to three-dimensional, making it easy to handle multidimensional arrays. The thread ID, along with the block ID, specifies the part of the workload the thread is responsible for. For example, in a matrix addition operation, each thread computes the sum of corresponding elements from input matrices **A** and **B**, storing the result in output matrix **C**.


### Programming Model 🖥️

CUDA programs consist of **two parts**: **host code** and **kernel code**.

- **Host Code**: This code runs on the CPU and is responsible for tasks such as:
    - Allocating memory on the GPU 💾
    - Copying data between the CPU and GPU ↔️
    - Launching kernels 🚀
  
- **Kernel Code**: This code runs on the GPU and is executed by CUDA threads. It defines the operations each thread performs.

The **host code** launches a grid of thread blocks, and each block executes the **kernel code** in parallel. For example, launching a grid of 6 thread blocks, each containing 12 threads, would launch **72 CUDA threads** simultaneously.


### Memory Model 🧠

CUDA has distinct **host (CPU)** and **device (GPU)** address spaces. Data must be moved between these spaces explicitly.

For example, to perform matrix addition on the GPU:
1. Allocate memory on the GPU 🖥️
2. Copy the input matrices from the CPU to the GPU 📤📥
3. Launch a kernel to perform the addition 🔥
4. Copy the output matrix back from the GPU to the CPU 🔄

CUDA kernels have access to **three types of memory**:
- **Global Memory**: Readable and writable by all threads. This is the largest and slowest type of memory. 🏋️‍♂️
- **Shared Memory**: Readable and writable by all threads within a block. Faster than global memory. ⚡
- **Private Memory**: Readable and writable only by the thread that owns it. Fastest but smallest type. 🚀


### Speeding Up Matrix Multiplication ➗

Matrix multiplication is a common operation that can be significantly accelerated using CUDA. Each **thread block** works on a portion of the matrices, and each **thread** is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix.

- **Shared memory** can be used to store tiles of the input matrices, improving **data locality** and reducing the number of accesses to **global memory**. 📊
- **Synchronization** mechanisms like `__syncthreads()` ensure that all threads within a block finish loading data or performing computations before proceeding to the next step. ⏳


### Tensor Cores: Higher Throughput and More Data Types ⚙️

Recent GPUs include **Tensor Cores**, specialized hardware units designed for high-performance matrix multiplication.

- **CUDA Core vs. Tensor Core**:
    - A **CUDA core** can perform one **FP32** or two **FP16** multiply-accumulate operations per cycle.
    - A **Tensor Core** can complete an entire matrix multiplication in **FP16** per cycle, offering **significantly higher throughput**. 📈

- **Workload Size and Performance**:
    - **Tensor Cores** are particularly effective for **large matrix multiplications**, with the performance gap widening as the matrix size increases. 🚀


### Matrix Multiplication Intrinsics (MMA) 🔢

To leverage **Tensor Cores**, CUDA provides **matrix multiplication intrinsics** (MMA). These intrinsics perform matrix multiplications on smaller tiles, which can be combined to compute larger matrix multiplications.

- For example, a **16x16x32** matrix multiplication can be computed using **16x8x16 MMA intrinsics**, breaking down the matrices into smaller tiles.
- The MMA instructions are applied iteratively to these tiles, accumulating the results into the output matrix. 🔄

> *Note: In-depth resources on CUDA programming are needed to learn how to specifically utilize Tensor Cores and MMA intrinsics.*

## 🔍 Inference Optimizations for CNNs

Beyond general techniques, the lecture highlights **tailored optimizations** for convolutional neural networks:

### 1. **Image to Column (Im2col) Convolution**
- Rearranges input data to use optimized matrix multiplication kernels.  
- **Variation**: Implicit GEMM reduces additional memory overhead.

### 2. **In-Place Depth-Wise Convolution**
- Reuses input buffers for output, minimizing memory usage.  
- Ideal for mobile-friendly architectures.

### 3. **Memory Layout: NHWC vs. NCHW**
- **NHWC** (batch, height, width, channels) suits **point-wise convolutions** for better locality.  
- **NCHW** (batch, channels, height, width) works well for **depth-wise convolutions**.

### 4. **Winograd Convolution**
- Reduces multiplications by applying transformations to inputs and filters.  
- Effective for **larger kernel sizes**.

> *"We want to minimize the amount of Kernel calls and do as much as possible within the Kernel ... that's called Kernel fusion."*

## 🛠️ TinyEngine: Efficient On-Device Inference

**TinyEngine** is an open-source library leveraging these optimizations to enable efficient inference.  
- Combines quantization with optimized kernel implementations.  
- Demonstrates capabilities by deploying **LLMs** like **LLaMA 2** on laptops.

> *"By combining these techniques we can deploy a large language model locally on a laptop."*
