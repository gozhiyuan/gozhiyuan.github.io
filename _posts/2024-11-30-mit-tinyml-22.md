## EfficientML.ai 📚 Lecture 22: Quantum Machine Learning

Modern AI models are becoming increasingly large, demanding substantial computational resources and memory. This creates a gap between the computational demands of these models and the available hardware capabilities. Pruning addresses this gap by reducing model size, memory footprint, and ultimately, energy consumption.

## 🔑 Key Themes and Ideas  

### ⚛️ Quantum Computing Fundamentals  
- **Qubits**: The basic unit of quantum information. Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), qubits exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.  
  > "...with only one qubit, we can represent many different states, not just 0 or 1, but all combinations between them."  
- **Quantum Gates**: Operations manipulating qubit states, analogous to logic gates but reversible. Examples:  
  - **Pauli Gates (X, Y, Z)**: Represent rotations on the Bloch sphere.  
  - **Hadamard Gate (H)**: Creates superposition states.  
  - **Controlled-NOT (CNOT) Gate**: Creates entanglement between qubits.  
- **Quantum Circuits**: Sequences of quantum gates applied to qubits for computation.  
  > "...you can have a bunch of qubits and quantum gates to manipulate their states..."  
- **Measurement**: Extracts information from qubits, collapsing their state into 0 or 1 (probabilistic).  
  > "...when we measure a qubit, it collapses to either 0 or 1."

### 🤖 Current Quantum Computing Era (NISQ)  
- **Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)**: Small, noisy qubits dominate the current era.  
  > "...we are still in an early stage with a lot of noise and limited qubits."  
- **Challenges**:  
  - **Noise**: Environmental disturbances lead to high error rates (e.g., 10⁻³ for single-qubit gates).  
  - **Limited Qubits**: Not enough qubits for advanced algorithms.  
  - **Connectivity**: Operations requiring "swap" operations introduce overhead.  
- **Focus on Error Correction**: Logical qubits add redundancy to tolerate errors.  
  > "...recent advancements focus on logical qubits leveraging error correction codes."

### 🔄 Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs)  
- **Tunable Gates**: Contain adjustable parameters (e.g., rotation angles).  
- **Expressivity**: Measures how well PQCs explore the Hilbert space.  
  > "The extent to which states generated deviate from uniform distribution."  
- **Entangling Capability**: Measures qubit entanglement using the Meyer-Wallach measure (0 to 1).  
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Assesses how well PQCs map to hardware.

### 🧩 Data Encoding Techniques  
1. **Basis Encoding**: Encodes classical data into binary quantum states.  
   > "Similar to binary representation in classical machines: X = 2 → binary '10' → quantum state |10⟩."  
2. **Amplitude Encoding**: Maps values to quantum state amplitudes.  
   > "Numbers are encoded as the state vector of the qubits."  
3. **Angle Encoding**: Maps values to rotation angles of quantum gates.  
   > "Encodes classical values using rotation gates."  
4. **Arbitrary Encoding**: Combines other encoding methods.

### 🏋️‍♂️ Training Quantum Models  
- **Gradient Descent**: Optimizes PQC parameters.  
- **Parameter Shift Rule**: Computes gradients by shifting parameters.  
  > "Shift θ twice to calculate gradients."  
- **SPSA**: Approximates gradients by perturbing all parameters, speeding up training.  
  > "...perturb all parameters together to obtain the gradient vector."  
- **Backpropagation**: Used on classical simulators of quantum systems.  
  > "Only usable on classical simulators via differentiable linear algebra."  

---

### 🧗 Challenges in QML Training  
- **Barren Plateaus**: Gradients vanish as circuit size grows.  
  > "...with more qubits, gradient variance decreases exponentially."  
- **Noise Impact**: Leads to unreliable gradients and reduced accuracy.  

#### 🎯 Noise-Aware Training Techniques:  
1. **Probabilistic Gradient Pruning**: Prunes unreliable gradients for faster training.  
   > "Small gradients have large relative errors. Use pruning windows."  
2. **On-Chip Training**: Trains directly on quantum devices to avoid simulation limits.

- **Features**:  
  - Various data encoders and quantum gates.  
  - Conversion to frameworks like Qiskit.

### 🔍 Quantum Architecture Search (QNAS)

- **SuperCircuit Approach**: Trains a single supercircuit with all design choices.  
  > "SuperCircuit = circuit with the most gates in the design space."  
- **Noise-Aware Evolutionary Search**: Optimizes subcircuits while considering noise.
