# üìö Manual Neural Networks

[Course Link](https://dlsyscourse.org/lectures/)

This document reviews the main themes and key takeaways from Deep Learning Systems: Algorithms and Implementation** at **Carnegie Mellon University**, taught by **J. Zico Kolter** and **Tianqi Chen**.


## 1. Limitations of Linear Classifiers üßÆ
- Linear classifiers divide the input space into linear regions, limiting their ability to model complex datasets.
- As stated in the lecture:  
  _"[Linear classifiers] basically chop up the space into $( K )$ different linear regions."_

## 2. Nonlinear Feature Mappings üåü
- **Definition**: Nonlinear feature mappings ($( \phi(x) )$) transform input features into a higher-dimensional space, making linear separation possible.  
  Example from the lecture:  
  _"Suppose this is the origin here. Then maybe a good feature vector for this case would be something like $( x^2 + y^2 )$. That would let us separate these classes with a linear classifier."_
- **Learnable Feature Mappings**: Neural networks learn $( \phi(x) )$ directly from data, enhancing flexibility:  
  _"This leads to a natural question: if we have a hypothesis like this... as well as all the parameters of the feature extractor itself."_

## 3. Neural Networks üß†

### Definition üìñ
A neural network is a hypothesis class composed of parameterized, differentiable functions ("layers") connected sequentially.  
_"A neural network refers to a hypothesis class consisting of multiple, parameterized differentiable functions (a.k.a. 'layers') composed together to form the output."_

### Two-Layer Network üîó
The simplest neural network:  
$$ [
h_\theta(x) = W_2^\top \sigma(W_1^\top x)
]
$$
- $( W_1, W_2 )$: Weight matrices.  
- $( \sigma )$: Nonlinear activation function applied elementwise.

### Deep Networks üåê
Generalizing the structure to $( L )$-layer networks:  
_"A generic $( L )$-layer neural network ‚Äì also known as a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), feedforward network, or fully-connected network."_

![alt_text](/assets/images/dlsys/03/2.png "image_tooltip")

### Universal Approximation üåå
- **Theory**: Two-layer networks with enough hidden units can approximate any smooth function.  
- **Caution**: This requires a large number of hidden units, which might not be practical:  
  _"It's a nice property but not that practical."_

## 4. Example: Two-Layer Network üß†

Consider a simple two-layer neural network, with weights $( W_1 )$ and $( W_2 )$. The hypothesis function is:

$$ [
h_\theta(X) = \sigma(XW_1)W_2
]
$$

where:
- $( X )$: Input matrix.
- $( W_1 )$: Weight matrix for the first layer.
- $( \sigma )$: Nonlinear activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).
- $( W_2 )$: Weight matrix for the second layer.


### Computing the Gradients üìê

To train the network using gradient descent, we compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to $( W_1 )$ and $( W_2 )$.


### Gradient with Respect to $( W_2 )$ üîÑ

The gradient for $( W_2 )$ is similar to the softmax regression case and is given by:

$$ [
\nabla_{W_2} \ell_c(XW_1W_2, Y) = (\sigma(XW_1))^\top (S - I_y)
]
$$

where:
- $( S )$: Softmax of the network's final prediction.
- $( I_y )$: One-hot encoding of the labels.

### Gradient with Respect to $( W_1 )$ üîô

The gradient for $( W_1 )$ is more complex and requires applying the chain rule multiple times. The final expression is:

$$ [
\nabla_{W_1} \ell_c(XW_1W_2, Y) = \big((S - I_y)W_2^\top \circ \sigma'(XW_1)\big) X^\top
]
$$

where:
- $( \circ )$: Elementwise multiplication.
- $( \sigma'(XW_1) )$: Elementwise derivative of the activation function applied to $( XW_1 )$.

![alt_text](/assets/images/dlsys/03/5.png "image_tooltip")


### Key Points ‚ú®
- The gradient computation for $( W_2 )$ uses the outputs of the first layer ($( \sigma(XW_1) )$) and the difference between the softmax output ($( S )$) and the labels ($( I_y )$).
- For $( W_1 )$, the chain rule propagates the gradient through the second layer ($( W_2 )$) and the activation function's derivative.

def nn_epoch(X, y, W1, W2, lr = 0.1, batch=100):
    """ Run a single epoch of SGD for a two-layer neural network defined by the
    weights W1 and W2 (with no bias terms):
        logits = ReLU(X * W1) * W2

    again, without randomizing the order of X).  It should modify the
    W1 and W2 matrices in place.

        # One-hot encode labels

## 5. General L-Layer Backpropagation üîÑ

### Purpose üéØ
An efficient algorithm for computing gradients of the loss function with respect to network parameters.  
_"Backpropagation is just the chain rule + intelligent caching of intermediate results."_

### Process üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Forward Pass**: Compute layer activations sequentially.  
2. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients using the chain rule:
   $$ [
   G_{i} = G_{i+1} \cdot \frac{\partial Z_{i+1}}{\partial Z_{i}}
   ]
   $$

Backpropagation in $( L )$-layer neural networks generalizes the process used for simpler networks. The main idea is to break down gradient computations into smaller, manageable steps using the chain rule and efficient caching.

![alt_text](/assets/images/dlsys/03/6.png "image_tooltip")

### Forward Pass üîÑ

- **Initialization**: The first layer output, $( Z_1 )$, is set to the input data, $( X )$.
- **Subsequent Layers**: For $( i = 1, \dots, L )$, compute:
  $$ [
  Z_{i+1} = \sigma(Z_i W_i)
  ]
  $$

  where:
  - $( Z_i )$: Activations of the $( i )$-th layer.
  - $( W_i )$: Weight matrix of the $( i )$-th layer.
  - $( \sigma )$: Nonlinear activation function applied elementwise.

- **Final Output**: The network's output is $( Z_{L+1} )$, which depends on the architecture and choice of activation functions.

### Backward Pass üîô

- **Start with Output Gradient**: Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the output layer:
  $$ [
  G_{L+1} = S - I_y
  ]
  $$
  where:
  - $( S )$: Softmax of the network's predictions.
  - $( I_y )$: One-hot encoding of the true labels.

- **Iterative Gradients**: For $( i = L, \dots, 1 )$, compute:
  $$ [
  G_i = \big(G_{i+1} \circ \sigma'(Z_i W_i)\big) W_i^\top
  ]
  $$
  where:
  - $( G_i )$: Backward gradient for the $( i )$-th layer.
  - $( \circ )$: Elementwise multiplication.
  - $( \sigma'(Z_i W_i) )$: Derivative of the activation function applied elementwise.


### Computing Parameter Gradients üìê

During the backward pass, calculate the gradients for each weight matrix:
$$ [
\nabla_{W_i} \ell(Z_{L+1}, Y) = Z_i^\top \big(G_{i+1} \circ \sigma'(Z_i W_i)\big)
]
$$

### Key Components:
1. **Incoming Gradient**: $( G_{i+1} )$, the gradient from the subsequent layer.
2. **Local Derivative**: $( \sigma'(Z_i W_i) )$, the activation function's derivative.
3. **Previous Layer Output**: $( Z_i )$, the activations from the previous layer.

![alt_text](/assets/images/dlsys/03/7.png "image_tooltip")

### Vector-Jacobian Product üìä

- The gradient computation involves a **vector Jacobian product**, where:
  - The "vector" is $( G_{i+1} )$.
  - The "Jacobian" is the matrix of partial derivatives of the layer's output with respect to its weights.


### Role of Caching üóÇÔ∏è

- **Efficiency**: Intermediate results from the forward pass, $( Z_i )$, are cached.
- **Usage**: These results are reused during the backward pass to compute gradients, avoiding redundant calculations.

### Implications ‚ö°

- **Memory Tradeoff**: Storing intermediate activations $( Z_i )$ increases memory usage, especially in deep networks and large datasets.
- **Efficiency**: Backpropagation computes all gradients in a single forward and backward pass.


### Conclusion ‚úÖ

- Backpropagation for $( L )$-layer networks is a foundational concept for training deep models.
- By modularizing gradient computation into forward and backward passes, it leverages:
  1. The **chain rule**.
  2. **Caching** for efficiency.
- These principles extend to advanced techniques like automatic differentiation.

_"We reuse intermediate results to compute all the gradients efficiently, exploiting the recursive structure of the network."_

- **Feature Mapping ($( \phi )$)**: Transforms input features into a new feature space for better learning.

- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for gradient computation during neural network training.
